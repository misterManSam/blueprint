# Blueprint for Google
Blueprint for Google is a userstyle that tries to redesign Google using a theme that follows the guidelines of the Material design language. It is ~~ripped~~ based off [this existing userstyle](https://userstyles.org/styles/116199/google-material-design-search), using some features of [Materialize.css](http://materializecss.com/) (obviously without the JS part) and what's left is mostly throwing rocks together and see if it works. The theme partly works, but some things are bound to look messy because of the very experimental status of it. On top of that, it is a total redesign that may apply to all Google sites.
